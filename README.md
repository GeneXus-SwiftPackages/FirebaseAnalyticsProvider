# GeneXus Analytics Provider for Google Analytics for Firebase

### Overview
The GeneXus Analytics Provider for Google Analytics for Firebase is a Swift package that facilitates the integration of Google Analytics for Firebase and other Firebase features such as Crashlytics and Remote Configuration into GeneXus applications. This package allows GeneXus developers to seamlessly incorporate Firebase analytics features into their iOS applications, gaining valuable insights into user behavior and app performance.

### What is Google Analytics for Firebase?
Google Analytics for Firebase is a robust analytics solution designed specifically for mobile and web applications. It provides developers with powerful tools to measure user engagement, track events, and gain a deeper understanding of how users interact with their apps. Firebase Analytics is part of the Firebase platform, offering a comprehensive suite of app development and improvement tools.

### What is Firebase Crashlytics?
Firebase Crashlytics is a real-time crash reporter that helps you track, prioritize, and fix stability issues that erode your app quality. Crashlytics saves you troubleshooting time by intelligently grouping crashes and highlighting the circumstances that lead up to them.

### What is Remote Configuration?
Firebase Remote Configuration is a cloud service that lets you change the behavior and appearance of your app without requiring users to download an app update. When using Remote Configuration, you create in-app default values that control the behavior and appearance of your app. Then, you can later use the Firebase console or the Remote Config backend APIs to override in-app default values for all app users or for segments of your user base.

### Features
Event Tracking: Easily track custom events within your GeneXus application to gather data on user interactions and behaviors.

User Properties: Define custom user properties to segment and analyze your user base based on specific characteristics.

Screen Tracking: Monitor the screens users visit within your app, allowing you to understand the flow of user navigation.

Crashlytics: Implement Crashlytics to track, prioritize, and fix stability issues that erode app quality.

Remote Configuration: Use Remote Configuration to customize your app, optimize user experience, and release new features without needing to publish a new version.
